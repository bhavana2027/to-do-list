📘 Overview

The To-Do List Web App is a simple and interactive productivity tool built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks, helping them stay organized and manage daily goals efficiently — all right in the browser, with no backend required.

🚀 Features

➕ Add new tasks easily

🗑️ Delete tasks when completed

✏️ Edit existing tasks (optional if added)

☑️ Mark tasks as completed

💾 Saves tasks in local storage so data isn’t lost on page refresh

🖥️ Fully responsive and clean user interface

🧩 Tech Stack

HTML5 – Page structure

CSS3 – Styling and layout

JavaScript (ES6) – Functionality and interactivity

⚙️ How It Works

The user types a task in the input box.

When the Add button is clicked (or Enter is pressed), the task appears in the task list.

The user can:

Mark a task as done ✅

Delete it 🗑️

(Optional) Edit it ✏️

All tasks are stored in localStorage, so they remain even after refreshing the page.
